# YouTube One-Click Unsubscribe 🚀

Are you tired of the tedious process of unsubscribing from YouTube channels one by one, clicking through endless menus and confirmation popups? **yt-oneclick-unsubscribe** is a simple browser script that lets you unsubscribe from any channel on your Subscriptions page with a single click-no extensions, no bulk tools, just pure, efficient control.

## ⭐️ Features

## 🛑 The Problem

YouTube makes it unnecessarily slow to manage your subscriptions.  
To unsubscribe from a channel, you must:

1. Click the **“Subscribed”** button.
2. Click **“Unsubscribe”** in the dropdown menu.
3. Click **“Unsubscribe”** again in the confirmation popup.

Doing this for dozens or hundreds of channels? It’s a nightmare.

## ✅ The Solution

**yt-oneclick-unsubscribe** automates the last two steps.  
With this script, you simply:

- Click the **“Subscribed”** button next to any channel.
- The script will automatically:
  - Click **“Unsubscribe”** in the menu.
  - Confirm in the popup.

That’s it! One click per channel, and you’re done.
